# Data Structures

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

- Different data structures excel at different things.  Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

- Working with
map/location data?
Use a graph!

- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?
Use a linked list!

- Web scraping nested HTML?
Use a tree!

- Need to write a scheduler?
Use a binary heap!
